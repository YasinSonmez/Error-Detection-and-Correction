# Error-Detection-and-Correction
Implementation of Hamming code, Repetition code, Block Interleaver and NRZ-M line coding

See the results and the code in the [notebook](https://github.com/YasinSonmez/Error-Detection-and-Correction/blob/main/BSC1.ipynb) and see the [internship report](https://github.com/YasinSonmez/Error-Detection-and-Correction/blob/main/UZAY%20Internship%20Report.pdf)

Here is what we achieved in this project:
- Implementing error-correcting codes such as Repetition code and Hamming code
- Implementing block interleaver
- Implementing NRZ-M line coding scheme
- Comparing error-correcting codes using bust error and bit flipping scenarios
- Plotting error probability vs. error rate for different setups
